# Welcome to the Mentore Help page

**Mentore** is a Graphical User Interface (**GUI**) which lets you easily add subjects, sentences and questions to your ontology.  
Here you will find a quick aid for all the main capabilities of the GUI.  
**Mentore** is supposed to work with the *Caresses.owl* ontology, and it only operates inside the *schoolSubject* concept.  
However, the code can be easily adjusted in order let **mentore** handle different ontologies and concepts.

### Main page

This is the first page you see when first launching mentore.  
Use this page to access all the functionalities of this tool.  
You will be albe to use the **Recently used subjects** feature once you have selected some of them.

### Add main page

This page is a menu that lets you choose which kind of element you wish to add: a new subject, a new sentence, or a new question.  
If the last 2 choices are greyed out, you first have to pick a subject.

### Browse page

Inside this page you will be able to examine an updated list of all the subject present in the ontology.  
When you pick one of them, it becomes the currently selected subject.

### Add subject page

This page allows you enter a new subject name and to add it to the ontology.  
Once you add the new subject, it gets automatically selected as the currently active one.

### Add sentence page

Here you can add a new sentence for the currently active subject.  
In the bottom-left corner of the page, you can choose which kind of sentence to add:

- **Positive sentence**
- **Negative sentence**
- **Wait sentence**

### Add question page

Similarly to the previous entry, this page allows you to add a new question (and answer) relative to the currently selected subject.  
You can specify the type of question in the bottom-left portion of the window. The possibilities are:

- **Plain question**
- **Goal question**
- **Contextual question**

Out of the 3 possibilities, **Contextual question** is the only one that requires you to give a paired answer.

### Help page

This is where you are now :)

## Features that will be supported in the future

The **mentore GUI** has been developed as part of a broader project, *A Motivational And Entertaining Ontology-based Robotic System For Education*.  
For this reason and due to time constraints, some desiderable features have not been implemented yet:

- The ability of deleting subjects, sentences and questions from the ontology
- A feeature that checks whether user-inputted data is already present in the ontology in the same form
