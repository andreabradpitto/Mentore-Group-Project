Done:

1. We designed Page1.ui and Page2.ui Files first using the 'Designer tool', and generated their .py files.
2. To link the buttons with the next pages, we had to edit the python code.
3. We copied the code of Page2.py, as a new 'class' inside the Page1.py file.
4. Now our Page1.py is the only file we need.
5. In this file, we have 2 classes, representing 2 separate windows.
6. We've also designed the Q-A page using the 'designer tool'

Working Now:

1. Click on '+' in the first window, this will bring you to the second window where you can add a new class.
2. Enter the class name inside the text box, and click on 'Add', this will close this window and will bring 
you back to the first main window.

To be done:

1. Design and link the 'Browse' page with the Browse button on the Main Window.
2. Link the 'Q-A' page with the class selected by the user either from the recently used, or from the browse.
