## ðŸ“° Additional information

**Mentore** has been coded with Ubuntu 20.04, but it has also been tested on Windows 10, and no issues were found.  
   
The window size of **mentore** is set by default to 800Ã—480, in order to match the screen resolution of the robot used in the overall project, *A Motivational And Entertaining Ontology-based Robotic System For Education*.
